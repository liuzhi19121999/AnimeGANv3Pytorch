# AnimeGANv3 for Pytorch

( [English](./README.md)  |  [中文](./Chinese.md) )

This is the PyTorch version of AnimeGANv3 model based on the original DTGAN model.

## Introduction

As AnimeGANv3 adopts the new DTGAN model and there is currently no corresponding open-source PyTorch solution, this project migrates some contents based on the original author's open-source TensorFlow version code.

## Updates

1. Migration of the Main Model Framework of DTGAN under PyTorch has finished.

2. Migration of the Main Model Framework of VGG19 under PyTorch was done, but with pre-trained parameters not loaded yet.
